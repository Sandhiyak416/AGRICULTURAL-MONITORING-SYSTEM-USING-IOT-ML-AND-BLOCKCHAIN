# Agricultural Monitoring System using IoT, ML, and Blockchain

A **smart farming solution** that combines **IoT**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Blockchain** to enhance agricultural practices. The system uses IoT sensors to collect real-time farm data, ML algorithms to predict crop health and yield, and Blockchain to securely store and share data with transparency and trust.

## 🌾 Features
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity  
- ML-driven crop health analysis and yield prediction  
- Blockchain for secure and tamper-proof data storage  
- Alerts and recommendations for precision farming  
- Data-driven decision-making for sustainable agriculture  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **IoT Devices:** Arduino / Raspberry Pi with sensors (soil, temperature, humidity)  
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Hyperledger  
- **Backend (API):** Python (Flask / Django)  
- **Frontend:** React.js / Angular  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. IoT sensors gather farm data like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.  
2. Data is sent to the backend for processing.  
3. ML models analyze data to predict crop health and yield.  
4. Blockchain secures data, ensuring trust and immutability.  
5. Farmers and stakeholders access insights via a dashboard.
